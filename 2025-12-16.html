                Salty Farm Ministries has always been a work of faith—feeding the hungry, providing mobile showers, and preparing for a tiny-home community where the homeless can find dignity and home. This testimony recounts how a ministry trip to Austin became a holy catalyst, exposing pressure, restoring unity, and confirming that God Himself is leading the mission. Through questions, spiritual attack, and a perfectly timed Christmas sermon, the Lord made clear: He goes before His people.

                <p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The ministry leaders travelled to Austin with their board members and architect to visit Community First Village—a powerful model of transformational housing for the homeless. They hoped the trip would bring clarity and unity. Instead, the visit stirred new questions about funding, sustainability, and vision. What initially felt like doubt soon revealed a deeper leadership lesson: questions are not rebellion. They are part of discernment, especially for those who haven’t shared the founders’ four-year journey through sacrifice and refining.

                <p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    While the team processed these tensions, a dark spiritual heaviness settled in, attempting to sow division. Stress escalated. Misunderstandings rose. The enemy pressed hard. But once the team returned home, unity was restored. Peace returned. And God began revealing how He had been orchestrating everything long before they even stepped foot in Austin.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    On Sunday morning, the ministry leaders attended church—exhausted, vulnerable, and seeking direction. The sermon titled “The Cost of Christmas” focused on Mary’s response to the angel: “Here I am.” The pastor urged listeners not to ask God “if” but “how.” Then, without prompting, he publicly affirmed the homeless mission God had placed on their hearts. Their architect, who had joined them that day, left church fully convinced and fully committed. Unbeknownst to them, the pastor had written the sermon weeks earlier. God had gone before them, preparing confirmation long before the questions ever surfaced.

                    Maybe you’ve been walking through a season where everything feels heavy. Maybe questions rise faster than answers, and you wonder if you’ve misheard God. But just like this testimony shows, God goes before you. He prepares conversations, sermons, provisions, and people long before you know you need them. If you’re weary, take heart: trials are real, but Sunday always comes. Hold onto mustard-seed faith. God is still writing your story, and He has not forgotten you.
